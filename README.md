### CONTEXT

<div>
  In recent years, we have seen a rapid expansion of digital currencies.
  At the same time, we cannot deny that the situation of the global economy is fragile.

  The current situation of the world economy has not yet fully recovered from the pandemic. Even before the war, inflation had accelerated in many countries due to supply-demand imbalances and government
  support during the pandemic, which led to a tightening of monetary policy.

  In this context, economic growth will continue to slow and inflation will continue to accelerate. Overall, economic and monetary risks have
  increased significantly.

  The NoMarkUp and TunCoin projects were born in this context, as debanking becomes a major issue for a lot of people among us. 
  On the other hand, E-commerce today does not benefit enough from the advantages that blockchain technology offers.

  We have developed a set of solutions based on blockchain technology and smart-contracts that we will be detailed below.
  We want this white paper to be accessible to beginners in this field, and exhaustive to those who are moe experienced.
  Our goal is simple, to create a system capable of protecting the economic and monetary interests of our users.
